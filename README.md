# iOS Day 1 - Card Dealing Game ðŸŽ´

Welcome to my iOS Day 1 project, where Iâ€™ve learned the basics of SwiftUI and Xcode! In this project, I built a simple card dealing game that focuses on using fundamental SwiftUI components like `VStack`, `HStack`, `Structs`, `States`, and more.

## What I Learned ðŸ“š
- **Xcode Basics**: Understanding content views, previews, and how to use assets.
- **SwiftUI Fundamentals**: Working with `VStacks`, `HStacks`, `ZStacks` and `Structs`.
- **State Management**: Using states to handle dynamic data in the app.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
- **Card Dealing Game**: A simple card game where cards are randomly dealt to the player and CPU.
- **Interactive UI**: See the results of your card dealing live on the screen.
